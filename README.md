## Steps to build and compile the code

To compile the c++ file you need to run the `make` command.
* run `make` command. This command will generate two files.
* `ConsoleApplication1` file is optimized file for execution.
* `ConsoleApplication1` file is also created, which is used for debugging purpose.
* Additionally you can use `make clean` command to delete the generated binaries.

## Input format

* I have take total 7 csv file as input for the library.
* These input files will be directly taken as input. You don't need to give the address.
* Three files i.e `books.csv, journals.csv, and magazines.csv` used for our library, and another three files i.e `outer_book.csv, outer_journal.csv, and outer_magazine.csv` is used for outside libraries. And 7th file i.e `requested_journal.csv` is used for the request of journals to buy.
* After that you just follow the prompt shown into the terminal, then you are good to go.

## List of References

- I have used `ChatGPT` for debugging and identifying the mistakes in my code.
- I have also used `StackOverflow` for identifying my silly mistakes.
- I have also taken help of online `YouTube` videos and `medium` platform to learn some fundamental needed to do the assignment.
